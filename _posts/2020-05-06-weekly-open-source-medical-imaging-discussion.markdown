title:  "Announcing Weekly Open Zoom Meetings"
date:   2020-05-06

Yesterday I met with [Erik Ziegler](https://github.com/swederik) and 
[Danny Brown](https://github.com/dannyrb) to explore the state of the 
Cornerstonejs/OHIF communities and ways we could improve things.  One
idea we came up with is to host weekly open meetings on Zoom to
discuss anything that anyone wants to talk about.  There is no agenda
but topics should be focused around open source medical imaging.  I am
going to try to make the meeting every week but will make sure someone
else is there if I can't for some reason.  [Erik Ziegler](https://github.com/swederik)
and [Danny Brown](https://github.com/dannyrb) will
also try to make the meetings when they can and I hope other leaders
will join regularly too.

Our hope is that this weekly meeting will help build the open source medical
imaging community by creating connections, sharing information and helping
each other.  

Feel free to ask questions, brainstorm new ideas, share about new projects
or any other topics that are related to open source medical imaging!

The meetings will be every Wednesday at 12:00PM (Noon) Central Time 
(Chicago/US) using Zoom:
