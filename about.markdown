I have over 20 years of professional software development experience in medical
 imaging.  Some notable highlights:
 * Creator of [CornerstoneJS](https://cornerstonejs.org/), the most popular
   open source project in the medical imaging industry.  CornerstoneJS is a 
   suite of libraries that enables software developers to quickly build modern
   web based medical imaging applications.

   industry.

   profit with the vision to lead open source development in medical imaging.
   While the non profit no longer exists, the leadership team still exists
   and is continuing to pursue this vision.
 * Lead architect and designer for the Stentor PACS System, the worlds first
   PACS system to deliver medical images digitally outside of the radiology 
   department.  Stentor was purchased by Philips and is currently known as IntelliSpace

   first highly scalable, highly avaialable advanced visualization server.
